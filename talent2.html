                    I have been playing the piano ever since I was 8 years old.
                    This is my maine instrument, and I have played it more than 
                    any other instrument.

                    I play the trumpet in my high school's jazz and symphonic 
                    band, and I am first chair in both. In jazz band, the first 
                    trumpet sets the style and volume for the entire band, so 
                    it's a big responsibility.

                    I started playing guitar during covid, and it's probably
                    the most relaxing of the three to play. It's much easier to 
                    sit down and sing while playing the guitar than on either of
                    the other two instruments I play. Additionally, it has lead 
                    me to discover I enjoy playing bass as well, so I might 
                    be able to add that to my list of instruments soon.
